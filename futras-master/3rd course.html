        <h1>Nutrition During Pregnancy</h1>

        <p>If you are pregnant, proper nutrition is crucial for both your health and the development of your baby. Here are some essential guidelines for maintaining a healthy diet during pregnancy:</p>

        <h2>1. Eat a Variety of Nutrient-Rich Foods</h2>
        <p>Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy products in your daily meals. This ensures that you and your baby receive a broad spectrum of essential nutrients.</p>

        <h2>2. Ensure Adequate Intake of Folic Acid</h2>
        <p>Folic acid is crucial for preventing neural tube defects in the developing baby. Include foods rich in folic acid, such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, and fortified cereals, or take a prenatal vitamin with folic acid as recommended by your healthcare provider.</p>

        <h2>3. Consume Adequate Calcium</h2>
        <p>Calcium is essential for the development of your baby's bones and teeth. Include dairy products, fortified plant-based milk, and leafy greens in your diet to ensure sufficient calcium intake.</p>

        <h2>4. Get Enough Iron</h2>
        <p>Iron is crucial for preventing anemia during pregnancy. Include iron-rich foods like lean meats, beans, lentils, and fortified cereals in your diet. Your healthcare provider may also recommend iron supplements.</p>

        <h2>5. Stay Hydrated</h2>
        <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Proper hydration is essential for supporting the increased blood volume during pregnancy and preventing dehydration.</p>

        <h2>6. Dietary and Caloric Recommendations</h2>
        <p>To maintain a healthy pregnancy, approximately 300 extra calories are needed each day. These calories should come from a balanced diet of protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sweets and fats should be kept to a minimum. A healthy, well-balanced diet can also help to reduce some pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and constipation.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Ideal Foods to Eat During Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>The following foods are beneficial to your health and fetal development during pregnancy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetables: carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, spinach, cooked greens, tomatoes and red sweet peppers (for vitamin A and potassium)</li>
            <li>Fruits: cantaloupe, honeydew, mangoes, prunes, bananas, apricots, oranges, and red or pink grapefruit (for potassium)</li>
            <li>Dairy: fat-free or low-fat yogurt, skim or 1% milk, soymilk (for calcium, potassium, vitamins A and D)</li>
            <li>Grains: ready-to-eat cereals/cooked cereals (for iron and folic acid)</li>
            <li>Proteins: beans and peas; nuts and seeds; lean beef, lamb and pork; salmon, trout, herring, sardines and pollock</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. The Importance of Folic Acid</h2>
        <p>The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that all women of childbearing age consume 400 micrograms (0.4 mg) of folic acid each day. Folic acid is a nutrient found in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some green leafy vegetables</li>
            <li>Most berries, nuts, beans, citrus fruits and fortified breakfast cereals</li>
            <li>Some vitamin supplements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Folic acid can help reduce the risk of neural tube defects, which are birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. Neural tube defects can lead to varying degrees of paralysis, incontinence and sometimes intellectual disability.</p>
        <p>Folic acid is the most helpful during the first 28 days after conception, when most neural tube defects occur. Unfortunately, you may not realize that you are pregnant before 28 days. Therefore, your intake of folic acid should begin before conception and continue throughout your pregnancy. Your health care provider or midwife will recommend the appropriate amount of folic acid to meet your individual needs.</p>
        <p>For example, women who take anti-epileptic drugs may need to take higher doses of folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. They should consult with their health care provider when considering trying to conceive.</p>
        <p>Always consult with your healthcare provider to create a personalized nutrition plan tailored to your specific needs during pregnancy.</p>
    
        <h2>Guidelines for Safe Food Handling</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wash.</strong> Rinse all raw produce thoroughly under running tap water before eating, cutting or cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Clean.</strong>Wash your hands, knives, countertops and cutting boards after handling and preparing uncooked foods.</li>
