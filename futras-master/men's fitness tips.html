    <h2>Veg diet plan</h2>

    Vegetarians enjoy a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruit with some also choosing to include dairy products, including cheese (made using vegetable rennet) and eggs. Studies suggest that a plant-based diet like this can be a healthier way to eat with fewer reported cases of obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. 
    Typically, a varied vegetarian diet contains less saturated fat and more folate, fibre and antioxidants, plus as a vegetarian you’re more likely to exceed the recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables.

    The Eatwell Guide defines the different types of foods we should be eating and in what proportions. 
    The guide explains some simple rules to follow like getting a minimum five-a-day of fruit and veg, including wholegrains and choosing more beans and pulses, while opting for lower fat, lower sugar dairy (or dairy-free alternatives). 
    But that's not the whole story. How much should you be eating and is there an ideal time to eat protein, carbs or fats? Read on for our guide to healthy eating around the clock.


    <h2>Non veg diet plan</h2>

    A great breakfast option is boiled eggs or scrambled eggs with oats. Lunch can consist of grilled fish or chicken with some steamed vegetables. 
    Snacks can include some roasted or boiled peanuts. For dinner, grilled or roasted chicken with a side of steamed vegetables is a great choice.
    
    <h2>Weight gain diet</h2>

    You can prepare your meals the night before or even a few days in advance, making sure you include the following top hardgaining foods.
    Protein ShakesLean Meat <br>
    Eggs.Salmon & Other Oily Fish.<br>
    Coconut & Olive Oil<br>
    .Sweet Potato.<br>

    <h2>Weight loss diet</h2>


    Many diets can help you lose weight and offer unique health benefits. 
    Some of the most popular eating plans include the Mediterranean diet, WW (Weight Watchers), the MIND diet, the DASH diet, 
    intermittent fasting, plant-based diets, low-carb diets, the Mayo Clinic Diet, and the Volumetrics diet.

    <h2>Morning diet routiene</h2>

    Starting your day with healthy breakfast foods can help you maintain energy, keep hunger at bay and lose weight. 
    Some studies suggest that regular breakfast eaters tend to be leaner and more successful at losing weight—and keeping it off—while others, such as a 2019 BMJ meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials found that's not true for everyone. 
    Whatever the case, people who eat breakfast typically get more of certain important nutrients, like vitamins, minerals and fiber, which plays a role in weight control.

    A healthy and balanced breakfast should deliver a mix of protein, complex carbohydrates, fiber and healthy fat to keep you full and fueled up for your day.
    Read on to find out some of the best healthy foods to eat for breakfast to help you lose weight and why they are so good for you.

    <h2>Mornig diet</h2>

    Weight gain is not everybody’s cup of tea. Some people gain weight in no time, while others struggle to do so. 

    It is common for people to struggle with gaining weight due to various reasons, like health conditions, an improper diet, unhealthy eating habits, lifestyle issues, and more. One habit that has been found in people struggling with weight gain is skipping breakfast or consuming an unhealthy or imbalanced breakfast.

    If you are also one of them and don’t know what to eat in the morning to put on weight, you are in luck!

    Today we are sharing the best healthy breakfast for weight gain. Not just that, we will also learn about what to eat in the morning and a few tips to remember for healthy weight gain.

    Before all that, let’s quickly look at the reasons that might be causing you difficulty gaining weight.

    <h2>Basic exercises for home workout</h2>


    <h3>Lunges</h3>

    Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. 
    Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes<br>
    Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.
    Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.
    Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.
    Complete. 3 sets of 10 reps.

    <h3>Pushups</h3>

    Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.
    Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.
    Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.
    If you can’t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees — you’ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.

    <h3>Squats</h3>

    Start by standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your sides.
    Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if you’re going to sit in a chair.
    Ensuring your knees don’t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for 1 second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position.
    Complete 3 sets of 20 reps.

    <h3> Standing overhead dumbbell presses</h3>

    Pick a light set of dumbbells — we recommend 10 pounds to start — and start by standing, either with your feet shoulder-width apart or staggered. Move the weights overhead so your upper arms are parallel to the floor.
    Bracing your core, begin to push up until your arms are fully extended above your head. Keep your head and neck stationary.
    After a brief pause, bend your elbows and lower the weight back down until your triceps muscle is parallel to the floor again.
    Complete 3 sets of 12 reps.


    <h3>Dumbbell rows</h3>

    Start with a dumbbell in each hand. We recommend no more than 10 pounds for beginners.
    Bend forward at the waist, so your back is at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Be certain not to arch your back. Let your arms hang straight down. Ensure your neck is in line with your back and your core is engaged.
    Starting with your right arm, bend your elbow and pull the weight straight up toward your chest, making sure to engage your lat and stopping just below your chest.
    Return to the starting position and repeat with the left arm. This is one rep. Repeat 10 times for 3 sets

    <h2>Beginner’s workout routine for men</h2>

    As a beginner, you can progress very quickly because almost any exercise promotes muscle and strength gains. Still, it’s important to avoid overexertion, which can lead to injuries or decreased performance.

    This workout routine has you in the gym 3 days per week (such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with full-body sessions completed each day. 
    This allows you to get used to new movements, focus on proper form, and take time to recover.

    You can add reps and sets as needed as you progress.

    The beginner phase should last as long as you continue to improve. Some people may plateau at around 6 months, whereas others may continue to see results for more than a year.
