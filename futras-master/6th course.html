        <h2>3. Create a Balanced Diet</h2>

        <h2>4. Incorporate Regular Exercise</h2>
        <p>Choose physical activities that you enjoy, making it more likely to stick with them. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Gradually increase intensity and duration over time.</p>

        <h2>5. Stay Hydrated</h2>
