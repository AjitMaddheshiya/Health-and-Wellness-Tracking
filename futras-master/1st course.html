        <li>1 cup mashed sweet potato</li>
        <li>1 beaten egg</li>
        <li>125 mL (Â½ cup) bread crumbs</li>

        <li>1 can of low sodium salmon (drained with skin removed and bones mashed)</li>
    </ul>

For older children: With your supervision, they can make the entire recipe.</p>
    <h2>2. Cheesy Chili Buns</h2>

    <p>Chili is a tasty way to introduce beans to your kids as long as you keep the chili spice mild. Cut off the top 1/4 of a whole wheat bun and scoop out some bread. Fill with chili and top with grated cheese. Broil and enjoy!</p>

    <p><strong>For Younger Children:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use small dinner rolls instead of a regular size bun.</li>
        <li>Invite the children to try a plain canned or cooked kidney bean.</li>
        <li>Let them sprinkle the cheese over top of the chili.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For Older Children:</strong></p>
    <p>With supervision while they cut the bread and use the stove, older children may be able to make this entire recipe.</p>

    <h2>3. Peanut Butter Fruit Sandwich</h2>

    <p>On your favorite whole grain bread, spread some peanut, almond, soy or sunflower butter. Top with sliced or mashed bananas, or get creative with sliced apples, pears or strawberries.</p>

    <p><strong>For Younger Children:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try using raisin bread or even banana bread for a treat.</li>
        <li>Ask your kids if they want square or triangular sandwiches.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For Older Children:</strong></p>
    <p>Buy some nut butter and challenge your children to see whether they can smell the difference between it and peanut butter with their eyes closed.</p>

    <h2>4. Salad in a Bag</h2>

    <p>Put different salad ingredients into a few bowls: torn romaine leaves, sliced carrots, peppers, cucumber, celery, broccoli and cauliflower florets, cherry tomatoes and so on. Let your children select a variety of their favorite vegetables and place them in a zipper-closed medium size bag. Serve with a favorite salad dressing. When ready to eat, let your children pour the dressing into the bag, close and shake it.</p>

    <p><strong>For Younger Children:</strong></p>
    <p>Ask what their favorite vegetables are and why. Then tell them your own favorites.</p>

    <p><strong>For Older Children:</strong></p>
